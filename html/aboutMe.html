                <h1 class="abobosik-h1">about me</h1>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">My name is Dima, I am 18 years old. I was born in Ukraine, and now I live and study in Slovakia at the University of TUKE.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">Programming was initially my hobby and interest. I started with creating games, the hobby appeared at the age of 12.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">Then I couldn't figure it out without help, and I started learning Python, knowing that at that time it was the most popular programming language.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">At the age of 15, I switched to learning HTML and CSS. Within a year I was learning algorithms, learning Python and backend in depth. In the last two years until I was 18, I decided to focus on frontend as that was the direction I was most attracted to.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">At the age of 16, my hobby turned into trying to make a living at it.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">For a long time I didn't take orders because I have a drive to do things with quality, especially for myself.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">At the moment I feel very confident in frontend and I think I can fulfill 85% of orders, although I still have little real experience.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">I learned frontend from video tutorials, pet projects and orders for people I know.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">I enjoy doing complex artistic websites, and I'm eager to further pump my skills by learning new techniques, effects, and animations.</h2>
                <h1 class="abobosik-h11">About the site</h1>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">The site was invented and created to fully demonstrate my abilities to customers or when hiring, as many sites I did not finish until the end, not seeing much point in it.</h2> <h2 class="abobosik-h2">The site was invented and created to fully demonstrate my abilities to customers or when hiring, as many sites I did not finish until the end, not seeing much point.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">On this site I have shown only three of my projects, of which two are unfinished, although I have about 20 other pet projects that I considered not very important to show.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">The site has been redesigned about six times, so you can see a few bugs or illogicalities. In addition, the site has poor logic, text meaning and structure, which will be corrected in the future.</h2>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h2">A new final version is planned in the future, in which maximum efforts will be made.</h2>
                <h1 class="abobosik-h11">About Design</h1>
                <h2 class="abobosik-h22 krim">I have always done all my designs myself (except for "PSTS"), but this design was done by @imaxpen - Zhenya, when I was a customer at the time.</h2>
